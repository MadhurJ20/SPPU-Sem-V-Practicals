# Laboratory Practice - I
For Laboratory Practice - I under SPPU Computer 2019 pattern, the 2 subjects I opted for are **Software Project Management Laboratory** & **Systems Programming & Operating Systems Laboratory**.

For SPML, I used **GanttProject**.

For SPOSL, I used **Java** as the programming language.
