I used Java to run these SPOSL programs.

## Steps to Install Java on Ubuntu

Update your repositories using:

`sudo apt-get update`

To install the default version of OpenJDK for your system, run:

`sudo apt install default-jdk`

To install the default version of OpenJDK JRE for your system, run:

`sudo apt install default-jre`

To check the version of Java that you have installed, run:

`java --version`

To show the directory in which Java is installed, run:

`echo $JAVA_HOME`
